A Halo that Protects the Maslows z-axis from damage

The hackspace has a maslow with a z-axis.  This sticks out the back of the router and is really easy for people to bump and damage.  To protect it I created this and decided to share.

## Equipment

- 12mm ply for the support arms
- 18mm ply for the rings
- 18 * M3 20mm socket button head screws
- 18 * M3 nyloc nuts
- 12 * 4.0x30mm wood screws

The thickness of the ply and the wood screw dimensions don't really matter.  Choose which works best for you.  Adjust the length of the button head screws to match the thickness of your support material.

I used 20mm because the material is 12mm, the thickness of the metal supports is another 5mm, and the nyloc nuts are 3mm; meaning 12+5+3 = 20mm

Using M3 screws are somewhat important as these are the size needed to fit the metal frame.  Nyloc nuts are used to stop the screws working free.


## My Build Instructions
1. make the templates by laser cutting the ring and supports on to 3mm mdf
1. using double sided tape, attach the templates to the ply
1. use a router trim bit to follow the template two rings and three supports out
1. using the template on the supports, drill 3mm holes for the screws where you need them


## Maslow Build Instructions
1. we havent got the maslow fully working yet, so until we do I can't write these up yet
1. a thing to note is that the template lines are accurate, if you are using maslow you need to somehow offset the cut by whatever size router bit you are using. We've got to get our one working before learning how to do this

## Assembly
1. attach each ply support to the metal arms using 6 socket button head screws and the nyloc nuts
1. attach the first ring using the wood screws to each support arm, its exact position will depend on which router
1. attach the second ring to the end of the support arm

## Things to Note
- by adding the halo you effect the weight and the balance of the router and sled.  If you make the halo too heavy and the router+sled  won't lean in to the cutting bed as much as needed
- the length of the supports can be adjusted to suit your router
